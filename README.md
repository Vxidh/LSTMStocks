# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM Neural Networks

This project provides a Streamlit web application for predicting stock prices and generating buy/sell signals using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The app retrieves historical stock data, computes technical indicators, trains an LSTM model with PyTorch, and visualizes both actual and predicted prices along with risk metrics and trading signals.

## Features

- Fetches historical daily stock data from Alpha Vantage.
- Computes technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ATR.
- Trains a customizable LSTM model for price prediction.
- Generates buy, sell, or hold signals based on predicted price changes and user-defined confidence thresholds.
- Visualizes price history, predictions, signals, and risk metrics.
- Provides risk assessment statistics including volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, max drawdown, VaR, and CVaR.
- Interactive sidebar for model and indicator configuration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # or
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Obtain a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
3. In the web interface:
   - Enter your Alpha Vantage API key and desired stock symbol.
   - Adjust model parameters, technical indicators, and thresholds as needed.
   - Click "Predict" to fetch data, train the model, and view predictions and recommendations.

## Notes

- The default API key is provided for convenience but may be subject to rate limits.
- Model training may take several minutes depending on your hardware and selected parameters.
